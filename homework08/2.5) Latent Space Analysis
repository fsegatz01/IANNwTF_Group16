We see that the data points from a class are piling in specific areas of the plot. Still there are also a lot of data points from one class
randomly scattered in the field. Also interestingly there are certain areas where none of the data points are.
Some labels like the 0 and 1 are way more piled than others like e.g. the 9.

We would have expected a clearer distinction of the classes in the position of the data points. Also kind of an positioning of the data points so that
number that show similar features like e.g. the 6 and the 9 are closer together than the data points from e.g. 0 and 1 (which for the 0 and 1 we can see in the plot
that piles do actually have a big distance to each other).
