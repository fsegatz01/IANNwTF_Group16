Unfortunately, we were not able to solve the task. There are dimension problems and exchanging
it with the tf.keras.layers.LSTM does not help. The dimension problems did not disappear after hours of trying.
Probably, the reason is already the preprocessing of the input and in which shape it is inserted into the network.
Nevertheless, we had no general problem understanding RNNs or LSTMs and if there would have been a q and a session or 
flipped classroom we would have asked, but the problem seemed to complex to aks for the solution in the forum. Please, 
apologize any code chaos that occurs, we really tried a lot.
