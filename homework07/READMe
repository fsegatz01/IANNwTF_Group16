Dear tutors,

Like you have probably already seen our code sadly does not work. 
Our problem is that we often encountered shape errors which were hard to tackle since we also weren’t quite sure if our preprocess function gives out the right shape.
There are dimension problems and exchanging it with the tf.keras.layers.LSTM does not help. The dimension problems did not disappear after hours of trying.
We got through lots of errors and could solve many of the problems, but we somehow got stuck in the pooling part.
Nevertheless, we had no general problem understanding RNNs or LSTMs. We are sure that if we had more time and also the possibility to again visit a q&a session
we would be able to make the code work. We also thought about posting in the forum but the problem seemed too complex to ask. Since this homework was overlapping
with the exam, Christmas holidays and the last week before these holidays it was for us not possible to already ask the questions that we have now in the q&a sessions
because there was simply not enough time to get the homework done until the sessions.
Please, apologize any code chaos that occurs, we really tried a lot.  We’ve put a lot of time and effort into this homework.
Therefore we would be very thankful if you could be understanding. Also if you have an idea how we could tackle the shape errors and make the program work
we would be very happy to hear from you.

Kind regards,
Group 16
