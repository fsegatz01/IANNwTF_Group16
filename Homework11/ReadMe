Dear tutors,

unfortunately, the detokenizing process in the generator method does not work. It is really strange, because if we put a 
static list into the detokenizer it works, but as soon as we want to put the dynamic tensor into the detokenizer it returns only errors. 
We tried a lot to solve this problem (see outcommended lines of code), but nothing worked. As the print statements show, the generator 
process works despite the detokenizing step.
We wrote an email this evening regarding the probelm but have not got a response yet and we were not sure how many late days we got left.

When we figure out what the problem was, we will upload a second version.
